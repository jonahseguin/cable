# Live delivery tests

This local-only test calls the real `telegram()`, `slack()`, and `email()`
adapters, then reads each destination through an independent provider API. It
is not part of normal package tests, Nx affected tests, or CI.

The configured destinations must be disposable. The test deletes their messages
before and after delivery. Telegram's immutable chat/channel creation service
record is ignored, but every text message is deleted. Do not use personal or
shared destinations.

## Configuration

Set these variables in an uncommitted environment file or the shell:

- Telegram: `CHANNELS_LIVE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`,
  `CHANNELS_LIVE_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, `CHANNELS_LIVE_TELEGRAM_API_ID`,
  `CHANNELS_LIVE_TELEGRAM_API_HASH`, `CHANNELS_LIVE_TELEGRAM_SESSION`
- Slack: `CHANNELS_LIVE_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`,
  `CHANNELS_LIVE_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`
- Email: `CHANNELS_LIVE_EMAIL_FROM`, `CHANNELS_LIVE_EMAIL_TO`,
  `CHANNELS_LIVE_FASTMAIL_API_TOKEN`,
  `CHANNELS_LIVE_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`,
  `CHANNELS_LIVE_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`

Telegram observation uses a non-bot Teleproto `StringSession`. Slack needs
`chat:write`, `channels:history`, and membership in the configured channel. The
email sender needs Cloudflare Email Service access; Fastmail supplies independent
JMAP observation and deletion.

## Run

```sh
pnpm --filter @cloudflare/channels test:live
```

Run one provider with Vitest's name filter:

```sh
pnpm --filter @cloudflare/channels test:live -t telegram
```

Each test sends `Cloudflare Channels live delivery smoke test.`, polls once per
second for up to two minutes, waits five more seconds for duplicates, and
snapshots the exact observed `[{ text }]` array.
