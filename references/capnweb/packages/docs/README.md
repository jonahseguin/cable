# capnweb-docs

The documentation website for Cap'n Web, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and
[Nimbus](https://nimbus-docs.com) (`@cloudflare/nimbus-docs`), Cloudflare's docs framework.

It was a Starlight site until the port that `git log` on this directory records. Nimbus is a
different proposition: rather than a theme with override slots, it scaffolds the layouts, routes and
components **into the repo** as ordinary files. Nothing here is behind a plugin boundary, which is
why this file can explain the whole site, and why upgrading is a review rather than a version bump.

`AGENTS.md` next to this file is the operating manual: the commands, the file tree, the authoring
rules. This file is why the site is the way it is.

## Running it

This package is **deliberately excluded from the repo's npm workspaces** (see `!packages/docs` in the
root `package.json`). The docs site pulls in Astro, Vite and a few hundred transitive dependencies,
and we don't want any of that hoisted into the tree that builds and tests the library itself. It
therefore has its own `package-lock.json` and its own `node_modules`.

```sh
cd packages/docs
npm install

npm run dev      # dev server at http://localhost:4321
npm run build    # static output in ./dist
npm run preview  # serve ./dist
npm run check    # astro check (types + content collections)
```

`dev` and `build` are both preceded by `npm run playgrounds`, which bundles the examples into
`public/playground/`. That step reads the library's **build output**, so run `npm run build` at the
repo root first, or just use `npm run dev:docs` there, which does both.

The examples no longer need to be running for the docs to work: their demos are bundled into the
pages. To run one as a real Worker over a real network, see `examples/README.md`.

Two things about installing, both of which have cost time:

**The `@cloudflare` scope may not resolve.** `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs` is on the public registry. A
machine whose npmrc maps that scope to an internal registry gets a 404 on install; override it for
the one command rather than committing an `.npmrc`:

```sh
npm_config_@cloudflare:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org npm install
```

**Wrangler is not a dependency here.** The starter lists one, at a version that resolves to an
unpublished alpha of miniflare. The root's wrangler deploys this site, so the dependency is simply
absent -- npm puts the root's on the path for scripts run from this directory anyway.

## What Nimbus owns, and what we changed

Nimbus provides the content schemas, the sidebar and table of contents, the markdown pipeline, the
search index, the OG-card routes, the `llms.txt` family of routes, and the `nimbus-docs` CLI. What it
does **not** do is own the layouts: `src/layouts`, `src/pages`, `src/components/ui` and
`src/styles` are files the scaffold wrote into this repo and we have been editing ever since.

That is a real trade. There is no `starlight.config` to read to find out what the page does, and no
upstream fix arrives on its own. In exchange, every question about this site has an answer in this
directory, and the framework cannot be blamed for anything visible.

The CLI tracks which of those files came from the scaffold and at what version:

```sh
npx nimbus-docs outdated        # starter files behind their tag, registry components behind
npx nimbus-docs diff <file>     # what upstream changed vs what we changed
npx nimbus-docs check           # build-free preflight: env, structure, authoring, types
```

Ten scaffold files are modified, so an upgrade to any of them is a merge and not an apply:

| File                              | Why it diverges                                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/styles/globals.css`          | The theme: palette, tokens, page shell, code chrome. Most of the port lives here.           |
| `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`    | The theme bootstrap: `is:inline`, dark as the no-preference answer, `data-theme` published. |
| `src/layouts/DocsLayout.astro`    | Marks `<main>` as the content sheet.                                                        |
| `src/pages/[...slug].astro`       | Serves the root index entry at `/` rather than `/index`.                                    |
| `src/pages/404.astro`             | `id="main-content"` on `<main>`, without which the skip link goes nowhere.                  |
| `src/components.ts`               | Registers our three components as MDX globals.                                              |
| `src/content.config.ts`           | The `%BUNDLE_SIZE%` frontmatter transform.                                                  |
| `src/pages/og/_og-card-config.ts` | Card palette, and the font moved out of `public/`.                                          |
| `tsconfig.json`                   | Excludes the generated playground bundles; no deprecated `baseUrl`.                         |
| `src/content/docs/index.mdx`      | It is our landing page.                                                                     |

Three of those are fixes to the starter rather than customisations, and should go upstream: the
404's missing skip-link target, the theme bootstrap emitting a deferred `<script type="module">`
(measured at about sixty frames of light flash under 20x CPU throttling), and `baseUrl`, which `tsc`
now errors on and `astro check` does not notice.

`nimbus.json` records what the scaffold and the registry installed and is committed. `.nimbus/` is
build scratch and is not.

Everything else under `src/components/` is either ours (below) or a registry component installed with
`nimbus-docs add`, which is why they are not hand-written: `add` brings a component's dependencies
with it.

Ours, and the reason each exists:

| Component            | Role                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Hero.astro`         | The landing page's headline, tagline and calls to action, over the stage. |
| `CanvasFigure.astro` | The hero's animated comparison, with the harness in `canvas-hero/`.       |
| `Features.astro`     | The landing page's bento figures.                                         |
| `NavList.astro`      | The landing page's link lists, built from `examples.ts` and a literal.    |
| `Playground.astro`   | The examples' source-and-demo stage.                                      |
| `Prose.astro`        | The prose container a `mode: custom` page has to bring itself.            |

Only `Hero`, `Playground` and `Prose` are registered as MDX globals; the other three are imported by
`index.mdx` directly, which is the other way a component can reach an MDX page.

`Prose` looks like ceremony and is not. `mode: custom` gives a page a bare `<main>`: no sidebar, no
table of contents, and no `.docs-content` wrapper or width cap either. Every prose rule in
`styles/prose.css` is scoped to `.docs-content`, so a custom page without `<Prose>` renders its body
text unstyled and edge to edge.

### The machine-readable surface

Nimbus emits a second, plain-text copy of the site, which Starlight did not: `/llms.txt` as an index,
`/llms-full.txt` and a per-section `/<section>/llms.txt`, and a markdown twin of every page at
`/<slug>/index.md` (also `.mdx`), linked from each page's `<head>` and from the "View as Markdown"
action under its title. `<AgentDirective />` in `BaseLayout` points a crawler at the index.

The thing to remember is that these routes derive their paths from the entry id, and the markdown
twins already special-case the root index so it lands at `/index.md` rather than `/index/index.md`.
`[...slug].astro` has to agree with them in two places, the route and the `markdownUrl` it advertises,
or the home page links at a 404. Leave `<AgentDirective />` where it is.

## Where the content comes from

**This site is the source of truth for user-facing documentation.** It began as a migration of the
repo's root `README.md` and `protocol.md`; the root README has since been trimmed to a landing page
that links here, and `protocol.md` is gone; `reference/protocol` replaced it.

If you change behaviour, update the page here. Two files still hold prose of their own and should be
kept in sync by hand:

| Source                                | Pages that mirror it                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Root `README.md`                      | `start/introduction`, `start/installation` (the intro bullets and the install snippet appear in both) |
| `packages/capnweb-validate/README.md` | `guides/validation`                                                                                   |

One number is never typed: `%BUNDLE_SIZE%` is substituted from `src/generated/bundle-size.json`,
which `scripts/measure-bundle.mjs` writes during prebuild by measuring the built library. It is
reached three ways, because there are three places a token can appear and only one pipeline sees each:
a Sätteri plugin for `.md` bodies, a schema `transform` for frontmatter, and a plain JSON import in
`index.mdx`, which interpolates it directly. `scripts/mdast-bundle-size.mjs` explains why the third
exists.

## The theme

`src/styles/globals.css` is the file to edit. The palette is a soft cool grey (`#eef1f4`) with slate
ink and a restrained Cloudflare orange CTA. Type is DM Sans for headings, body and UI, and Commit
Mono for code.

Light mode is a genuine second scheme rather than an inversion. The sidebar and the content sheet
share `--nb-background`: one surface, not a darker rail meeting a lighter document.

Both schemes are held to WCAG AA at their real sizes, measured on the surface each thing actually
sits on rather than on the one it nominally belongs to. That distinction is what most of the
failures turned out to be: `--nb-muted-foreground` cleared AA on the sheet and missed it on the
ground, and the ground is what shows through the table-of-contents rail and the masthead. The audit
harness walks every text node on a page, resolves the effective background through however many
translucent ancestors it has, and reports anything under 4.5:1 (3:1 for large text). It currently
reports one hit in each scheme, and that hit is the hero title, whose colour is `transparent`
because the gradient is clipped to the glyphs.

The harness reads colours by painting them into a 1x1 canvas rather than by matching `rgb(...)`.
That is not fussiness: `color-mix()` and Tailwind's `/40` alpha modifier make
`getComputedStyle().color` come back as `color(srgb ...)` or `oklab(...)`, and a regex parser
silently *skips* what it cannot read, so the nodes most likely to be too faint are exactly the ones
that vanish from the report. Switching to canvas surfaced 41 more per scheme on the first run. It
also scopes to WCAG's own definition of text and reports anything inside an `aria-hidden` subtree
separately, since decoration is held to 3:1 as a graphical object, not 4.5:1 as prose.

### Two families of token

Nimbus's own tokens are `--nb-*`, and Tailwind utilities like `bg-card` and `border-border` are
generated from them in the `@theme` block. Ours are `--cw-*`: the raw palette, plus the handful of
values the page shell needs that have no Nimbus equivalent.

| Token              | Dark      | Light     | Used for                                  |
| ------------------ | --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `--cw-ground`      | `#090c10` | `#e2e7ec` | the ground the page sheet rests on        |
| `--nb-background`  | `#0c1014` | `#eef1f4` | the content sheet and the desktop sidebar |
| `--nb-primary`     | `#f6821f` | `#f6821f` | primary actions                           |
| `--cw-orange`      | `#f6821f` | `#f6821f` | the CTA spark, Cloudflare orange          |
| `--cw-orange-text` | `#f6821f` | `#a85608` | the same spark, when it is text           |

Three of those need saying out loud, because each is a place where the obvious value is the wrong
one:

- **The orange is Cloudflare orange, and it is not ours to adjust.** `#f6821f` is the brand's value.
  It is the same hex on both schemes and it does not get darkened, tinted or theme-swapped to win a
  contrast argument. What changes with the theme is the *text* on it.
- **The label on the orange is `--nb-background`, so it inverts with the scheme, and light mode is
  a sanctioned exception to AA.** This orange is bright, so the pairing lands well one way and badly
  the other: near-black on it is 7.67:1, near-white on it is 2.28:1 against a 4.5:1 requirement. The
  brand pairing was chosen over compliance deliberately, and it is the only such exception on the
  site. The hover is the one concession -- it darkens in light mode instead of lightening, so the
  label recovers to 3.34:1 while the control is in use, and lightens in dark mode to Cloudflare's
  own `#fbad41` for 10.52:1.
- **Orange as text is not the same orange as orange as a fill.** The brand orange is 2.3:1 on the
  paper, so anything set in it at body size is not merely off-spec, it is unreadable.
  `--cw-orange-text` is the same hue darkened to 4.6:1, and in dark mode it is just the brand
  colour, which needs no help there. The exception above is for the brand mark on a fill; it is not
  a licence to set prose in an illegible colour.

The palette is kept as hex rather than converted to oklch, which the scaffold's own comment
recommends. These are measured, tuned values carried over from the theme this replaced, and a round
trip through another colour space would move them for no gain.

### The page is a sheet on a ground

Three layers, so that the reading column reads as a panel resting on something rather than as the
page itself:

1. `body` paints `--cw-ground`, a shade off the sheet. `BaseLayout` deliberately leaves
   `bg-background` off it.
2. `body::before` adds two fixed radial washes at `z-index: -2`, so the ground is a space rather
   than a flat fill.
3. `<main data-cw-sheet>` paints `--nb-background`. The sidebar uses Nimbus's own `bg-background`
   and a single `border-r`; the table-of-contents rail is left transparent.

So the washed ground shows through the right-hand rail and the page margins, and, blurred, through
the masthead, which is `bg-background/80` over a `backdrop-blur`. The current page in the sidebar is
Nimbus's own `bg-accent` highlight, not a second indicator painted on top of it.

There used to be a fourth layer between the washes and the sheet: a CSS constellation of nodes and
edges, fixed at `z-index: -1`, drawn behind every page. The landing redesign replaced it with the
hero's own stage and dropped it from docs pages entirely, which is why those pages now idle at 0.0%
of a core. `git log -- src/lib/constellation.ts` has the whole thing if it is ever wanted back.

The landing page is the exception to the layering: it paints its own dark stage edge to edge behind
the hero, so `body:has(.cw-hero-field)` suppresses the wash and sets the body to `--nb-background`,
which is exactly where the stage's veil finishes fading, so the seam below the hero lands on a single
value.

### Which scheme loads

The mode attribute is `data-mode` on `<html>`, present as `"dark"` and **absent** in light. The
stored choice is `ui-mode` in `localStorage`.

The bootstrap in `BaseLayout.astro` queries `(prefers-color-scheme: light)` rather than `dark`, on
purpose: the site was designed dark, so a reader whose OS expresses no preference gets dark. A stored
choice still wins over the OS.

The landing page used to be outside all of that: it was a fixed dark design, the bootstrap resolved
`/` to dark whatever was stored, and the toggle was hidden there because it would have done nothing.
It is no longer exempt. `.cw-home` remains on the body, but it now marks the page rather than its
scheme, and the two rules that still key off it are about the hero, not about being dark.

The two `theme-color` metas are media-scoped, so a first visit gets browser chrome that matches the
OS before any script runs. A stored choice that disagrees with the OS is reconciled by the bootstrap,
which drops the media condition from whichever one won.

It also publishes `data-theme="light" | "dark"`, which nothing in Nimbus reads. The example
playgrounds do: they are same-origin iframes that read the embedding page's theme before their first
paint, and an attribute that is absent half the time cannot be read positively by a document that
may load either way round. `Playground.astro`'s own light override keys off the same attribute.

That script must keep its `is:inline`. Without a directive Astro processes it into a deferred
`<script type="module">`, the document paints before it runs, and a reader whose stored choice is
dark gets a flash of the light scheme first.

With JavaScript off the page renders light, which is accepted: the alternative is a dark default in
CSS and a flash of dark for light-mode readers, which is the more common case and the more jarring
direction.

### Type

The site self-hosts DM Sans (variable) and Commit Mono through `@fontsource`, imported in
`BaseLayout.astro`: 83.1 kB on a first visit, latin subsets only, then cached for a year by
`public/_headers`.

DM Sans (`--nb-font-sans`) carries body, UI and headings; Commit Mono (`--nb-font-mono`) is code.
There is a `--nb-font-display` token for headings, but it currently aliases `--nb-font-sans`: a
separate display face (Cal Sans) was tried and dropped, and the token was left in place as the seam
to reintroduce one. Following the Kumo design skill (kumo-ui.com/skill), headings are set at the
font's natural tracking rather than letter-spaced (`--nb-h*-tracking: normal`), sizes are a small set
of deliberate steps, and nothing in the chrome is uppercased.

This is a change from the Starlight build, which used the system stack and shipped no fonts at all.
It is a deliberate keep: the type is then identical on every OS, and the heading scale in
`globals.css` was tuned against it. If it ever needs reverting, it is the imports and the
`--nb-font-*` tokens, and the site will want a fresh visual review afterwards.

There are no raster images anywhere in the site's own chrome: the favicon is SVG, and apart from the
hero's canvas figure every texture is a gradient.

## The homepage hero

The hero is a headline, a tagline, an animated figure and two buttons, in that order, over a stage
that is pure CSS. `Hero.astro` owns all of it. There is no canvas behind the copy and no WebGL
anywhere on the site.

The stage is a wide radial pool of `--cw-hero-stage-bg` over the page background, taller than the
hero so it runs on behind the first band of prose rather than ending in a seam, with a veil over it
that dissolves the edges back into the page and harder at the bottom. `globals.css` suppresses the
page's own top decoration for any page containing `.cw-hero-field`, so the two never stack.

The order matters and is a prop. `illustration="below"` puts the copy first; the default puts it
after. The landing used to lead with a pair of code windows and treat the headline as their caption,
which works because a static block of code is taken in at a glance. An animation is not: it has a
running time, and opening on one asks the reader to work out what they are watching before being
told why.

Everything vertical in the hero is tuned to one 40px module: tagline to figure, figure to buttons,
buttons to the first band of prose. The last of those is `.docs-content`'s own top padding and the
hero contributes no bottom padding at all, so the figure sits in the page's existing rhythm rather
than inventing one.

The two CSS margins around the figure are deliberately *not* the same number, though, because the
gap the eye judges is to the figure's ink and the canvas does not fill its own box: the scene leaves
10px clear above the column headers and 21px of the verdict's descender room below the axis. The
margins are 40 minus those, which lands all three gaps at a measured 40-42px ink to ink.
Compensating here rather than tightening the scene is the cheaper side of the trade -- reclaiming
the bottom space would move `bottom`, and that moves every vertical position in the figure and every
region in the contrast harness with it.

### The wordmark

The landing page is set the way [capnproto.org](https://capnproto.org) is set: a fat Bookman
lockup with white letters and a heavy black keyline, a starburst seal stuck on its bottom corner,
and the pair sitting on a coloured band that stops dead where the prose begins.

The band is `.cw-hero-banner`, and its hard bottom edge is the point of it: a cereal box is
printed, not blended, so the artwork ends on a line rather than fading into the page.

**There is exactly one definition of the band: `--cw-band` in `globals.css`.** Every layer in it is
translucent -- a `104deg` linear gradient running 12% to 31% opacity, lifted by two soft elliptical
accents in blue and green at around 13% -- so the page shows through and a single declaration
serves both schemes. On paper it reads as a pale blue-to-teal wash; over near-black it reads as a
faint tint of the same sweep. There is no light-mode override any more, and there should not be
one: the previous design themed the base gradient and had to keep two bands honest against each
other. If you change the stops, change them here.

Two other surfaces reuse the same artwork and cannot read a custom property, because they are SVG:
the README banner and the social card. `build-wordmark.mjs` therefore keeps a hand copy of the
stops in `BAND_STOPS` and `BAND_ACCENTS`. Change one, change the other, and regenerate.

**On a light page the mark is carried by its keyline, not by its fill.** The wordmark is white and
does not flip, so the band is what the white is read against, and a translucent band over paper is
pale: measured across it, white against the band is 1.56:1 on average and 1.23:1 at its lightest.
The white fill and the light band are near enough the same value that the letterforms are defined
entirely by their 8px black keyline. That is a legitimate look -- outlined display lettering is
exactly what the reference is doing -- but it is a different mechanism from dark mode, where the
same pair measures 15.45:1 and the fill does the work. The mark is decorative artwork rather than
text, so no 1.4.3 obligation attaches, but two things follow. Don't thin the keyline, because on
light it is the logo. And don't lighten the band further expecting the mark to survive it; the
lever that actually exists is `--cw-mark-fill`, which inverts the mark to a black fill and is a
different logo rather than a lighter one.

The seal is stuck on the mark's bottom right and hangs off the band. That arrangement came from
the live reference: capnproto.org's is `position: absolute` with a `z-index`, its left edge sits
50px behind the final O, and **19% of its height is below the banner's edge**, over the section
beneath. The overhang is the whole effect -- a seal that stops at the edge reads as part of the
picture, and one that crosses the edge reads as a sticker put on afterwards, which ties the band
to the page instead of leaving it a floating slab. Nothing from the banner down may set
`overflow: hidden` or the seal is guillotined.

Ours hangs a flat **20px** (`--cw-seal-overhang`), which is 15.6% of the desktop seal and 19.2% of
the smaller one a phone gets. It is stated as a length rather than as the reference's percentage
on purpose: the overhang is the one thing about the seal's position that the eye actually reads,
and expressing it as a fraction of the seal meant that resizing the seal silently moved it. Two
consecutive rounds of "make the star bigger" each pushed it further off the band without anyone
asking for that. Now the seal's `top` is derived from the overhang instead of the other way round,
and "raise it a little" is one number.

`.cw-hero-lockup` is sized to the mark exactly, because it is the seal's containing block and
every offset is a percentage of it -- that is what keeps the seal on the same spot of the artwork
as the mark resizes, instead of needing a breakpoint per width. Two things do need a breakpoint.
Below 48rem the seal is pulled in from 94% to 86% and shrunk, because out at 94% a phone has no
room to hang into and the page scrolls sideways instead. And the band's inline padding widens to
`2rem` there, which is what sets the mark's size on a phone: the lockup is `min(100%, cap)`, so
the 100% branch is the one taken and lowering the cap does nothing at all. At `1rem` the mark ran
nearly edge to edge and read as oversized, because a logo needs air around it to look placed
rather than cropped.

The mark is also nudged left of its own centre, which is not a correction -- its ink is centred in
its box to within a few units. It is the seal being paid for. The seal hangs off the right and is
the heaviest, most saturated thing in the band, so a mark centred by geometry sits right of where
the composition's weight actually is. Centring the pair's bounding box only accounts for about
22px of the 74px; the rest is that orange outweighs its area. Only the mark moves, and the gap
that opens between the two is what puts the seal beside the B rather than on top of it.

Below `34rem` the seal is not drawn at all. It stops sitting beside the B and lands on it, and
shrinking it further would make the legend unreadable before it made the overlap acceptable. That
is not a new breakpoint: it is the one `Features.astro` uses to drop the bento to a single column,
and it is the same judgement -- the page has stopped being wide enough for two things side by
side. The mark's nudge goes to zero at the same width, since there is no longer a seal to
counterweight.

**It is hidden the `sr-only` way, not with `display: none`.** The legend inside the seal is the
page's `<h1>`. Nothing is painted below `34rem`, but the heading stays in the document outline and
in the accessibility tree, which is verified rather than assumed: the harness checks that there is
still exactly one `<h1>`, that it reads "One round trip!", and that it appears as a heading in
Chrome's accessibility snapshot at every width down to 320px.

`--cw-hero-nudge` is a `clamp` rather than a number, because the nudge needs slack to move into
and how much exists depends on the viewport. The lockup is `min(100%, cap)`: above roughly 41rem
it has hit the cap and the band is wider than it, so there is room either side; below that the
lockup fills the band and there is none, and a fixed nudge walks the mark straight off the left
edge. The clamp grows the nudge with the slack and reaches zero at 30rem, before the slack does,
which is what keeps a phone centred without a breakpoint and without overflow. Measured at 360px
the mark sits 32px from the left and 35px from the right; at 1440px it is 77px left of centre.

`scripts/build-wordmark.mjs` generates `src/components/logo-paths.ts`. It is not part of the
build -- it runs when the mark changes, which is close to never -- and it needs a font file and
`opentype.js` that the site does not otherwise depend on. Its header comment has the two commands
that fetch them.

Most of its constants are numbers taken off capnproto.org, and on their own they are unfalsifiable
magic. `scripts/measure-wordmark.mjs` re-derives every one of them from the reference art and
prints it next to the value actually in use:

```sh
node scripts/measure-wordmark.mjs        # fetches the two reference PNGs
```

It has no dependencies -- it decodes PNGs with `node:zlib` in about fifty lines rather than
booting a headless browser for a canvas -- so it still runs in a checkout with nothing installed.
Differences of a pixel are the two measuring methods, not drift; it explains which gaps are
deliberate and prints the reasoning. It found a real error the first time it ran, so it earns its
place: `PROTO`'s cap height had been recorded as 114px and is 124px, which had propagated into
four comments here and in the build script as a cap ratio of 1.152 instead of 1.24.

Six things in there are worth knowing about.

- **The face is TeX Gyre Bonum Bold, and must stay that way.** capnproto.org's mark is URW
  Bookman, which is installed on most Linux boxes and is the obvious thing to reach for. It is
  AGPL-3, and its font exception covers only "a Postscript or PDF file" -- not SVG on a web page.
  Bonum is the same Bookman design under the GUST Font License, which has no such limit. Only the
  converted outlines ship either way, but the licence still follows them.
- **The mark is geometry, not text.** Setting it as live `<text>` would be a tenth of the bytes
  and would mean the mark rendered in Georgia for anyone whose webfont was slow or blocked. For
  body copy that is a degraded state; for a logo it is the wrong logo.
- **It is a tilt, not an arch.** It reads as text on a circle and the first attempt built it that
  way. Fitting each glyph of the reference independently -- best scale and rotation by
  intersection-over-union -- puts every well-determined letter within a degree or two of the same
  angle. It is one rigid tilt, with a few degrees of per-glyph scatter and an oversized initial on
  the second line, and those three things together are what read as an arch. The round letters fit
  at IoU 0.67 because a round letter is nearly invariant under rotation, so their fitted angles are
  noise and were thrown away.
- **The scatter is hand-set, and copied rather than invented.** A least-squares baseline through
  the reference's letters is -5.6 degrees for `CAP'N` and -7.1 for `PROTO`, and the letters sit
  21px and 9px peak to peak off those lines against caps of 100 and 124. That is a hand-set
  wordmark, not a rendered one, so the script carries a per-glyph `rot`/`dy`/`scale` array and the
  vertical residuals for `CAP'N` are the measured ones: C -2.4, A +10.2, P -11.8, N +4.1. The
  reference's `P` is set 1.27x the rest of its line; `W` here gets 1.15, because `W` is already
  the widest letter in the alphabet and the full ratio ran it into the margins. Regenerating with
  the jitter zeroed produces something visibly deader, which is the whole argument for keeping it.
- **One path per glyph, never one per line.** Merged into a single path the letters become
  subpaths of one shape: the fill floods their union, and since `paint-order: stroke` lays every
  keyline down first and then covers it with that union, any keyline running through a touching
  pair vanishes. Tight pairs merge into a blob and stray serifs poke out as unstroked white.
- **Contours have to be closed by hand.** `opentype.js` 2.0.0 returns glyph outlines as open runs
  of M/L/C/Q with no `Z` anywhere. A fill closes an open subpath implicitly, but with a straight
  chord that cuts the corner off a slab serif, and a stroke does not close it at all, so the
  keyline is missing along every contour's last edge. The symptom looks exactly like neighbouring
  glyphs overprinting each other, which is a long way from the cause; `closeContours` is the fix.

The two lines are sized against each other rather than independently, and that ratio is the one
number here that is *not* copied. The reference runs a 124px cap under a 100px one, a ratio of
1.24; this lockup is at 1.28. It cannot be 1.24, because `WEB` is three letters where `PROTO` is
five -- at the reference's ratio the lower line comes out visibly narrower than the upper one and
the block falls apart. 1.28 is where the two lines land within a couple of percent of the same
width, which is what the reference achieves by a different route. An earlier pass sat at 1.39 and
read as a second, louder logo stacked under the first. Changing `size` on either line changes the
leading too, since `LEAD` is a multiple of the lower line's cap: after any change, check the
clearance the build prints still falls in the reference's 17-34px, and move `LEAD` if it does not.

The seal is a regular 20-point star, inner radius 0.81 of its outer. The reference's points land
on exact 18 degree centres, so this one's do too -- an earlier version jittered them on the theory
that a stamped seal would be irregular, and the reference simply says otherwise.

The same script emits `public/favicon.svg`, and it is deliberately *not* the same star. Twenty
points at 0.81 is a circle with a fuzzy edge once it is 16 pixels wide: the points are two pixels
long and antialiasing eats them. The favicon is 11 points at 0.55, tuned by rendering the sweep at
16/20/24/32/64 on both a light and a dark tab strip. The ratio is tuned for 32 physical pixels
rather than 16, because a HiDPI tab strip asks for the icon at 2x and that is where the points
actually resolve; below about 0.5 the star keeps its points but sheds so much ink that the 16px
rendering reads as a faint sparkle instead of a stamped seal. Eleven is odd, so the offset is zero
and a point aims straight up -- an even count centres a point top *and* bottom and reads as a cog.
There is no lettering on it, and the fill is `#f6821f` written out longhand because a favicon is
its own document and inherits none of the page's custom properties -- keep it in step with
`--cw-orange` by hand.

### The banner in the root README

The same script emits a third thing, and it leaves this package to do it: `assets/capnweb-banner.svg`
at the repository root, which `scripts/build-banner-png.mjs` rasterises to the PNG the root README
shows. That README is also the npm package page, and npm is what dictates the whole design.

The band is painted **translucent**, and everything else follows from that. A README image cannot
read custom properties or `prefers-color-scheme`, so the usual trick is a `<picture>` with a light
file and a dark one -- but npm's markdown sanitiser is more aggressive than GitHub's and drops
`<source>`, and npm now has a dark theme, so a stripped `<picture>` would show dark-mode npm users
the light variant on a dark page. One file has to work on both.

Translucency is how it does that: the same `--cw-band` stops the site uses, composited over
whatever the host page happens to be, so the image adapts instead of choosing. On GitHub light it
is a pale wash, on GitHub dark and on npm's dark theme it is a faint tint over near-black. This is
the opposite of the earlier design, which painted the band opaque precisely so it would render
identically everywhere, and the trade is deliberate: identical-everywhere meant a dark slab sitting
in a white page.

Three things make it survivable, and all three have to keep working. The wordmark is white with a
heavy black keyline, so on a pale composite the keyline defines it (see the band section above --
this is the same 1.23:1 fill). The seal is Cloudflare orange with a dark keyline, which holds on
white and on near-black. And the seal's legend is **knocked out with a `<mask>`** rather than
painted: the words are holes, so the host page shows through them and they invert for free -- white
lettering on GitHub light, dark on GitHub dark.

That mask wraps the entire composite -- band, wordmark and seal -- and not just the star, which is
subtler than it sounds. Masking only the star leaves two things behind each hole. The seal's drop
shadow fills the letters with 32% black, giving grey words instead of the page. And the band, being
translucent, keeps painting: the glyphs came out at alpha 76 carrying the band's own colour, which
looks approximately right on a dark page and visibly wrong on a light one. The letters have to be
holes in the finished image, not holes in one layer of it. Because the mask now applies to the whole
canvas, its region and its white backdrop must be the whole canvas too: anything outside a mask's
region is treated as black, so a seal-sized region would erase the rest of the artwork.

Below the band the canvas is fully transparent, so the seal reads as overhanging a real edge. The
seal also sits
further right than it does on the site: at the site's 91.5% it lands on the `B` and the lower line
reads "WEE", because the site's seal hangs off a full-bleed banner with the whole viewport to its
right and this one does not.

Two things are worth knowing before touching it.

- **It ships as PNG, and that is a deliberate step down from SVG.** GitHub renders SVG in a README,
  and `raw.githubusercontent` even serves it as `image/svg+xml`, so SVG would very likely work --
  but the npm page is the first thing most people see and a PNG has no sanitiser story at all. The
  SVG stays in the repo as the source, and for anywhere the vector is wanted. The README references
  it with plain markdown rather than a centred `<div>`, since a full-width banner needs no centring
  and gives npm nothing to strip.
- **The PNG is quantised, and `sharp` will do that to you silently.** Passing `effort` without
  `palette` enables quantisation while reading like a lossless option; the encode here asks for
  `palette: true` outright. It survives quantisation only because Chrome dithers the gradient as it
  rasterises, and that noise both inflates the file and hides the palette. If the artwork ever
  loses the gradient, re-check it: flat colour has no noise to hide behind.

### The social cards use the same art

The cards are still drawn per page by `astro-og-canvas` -- 33 of them, one per title -- because it
rasterises with canvaskit and wants no browser in the build. What it cannot draw is this band: it
takes a list of gradient stops, and the band is a linear gradient with two elliptical accents over
it. So the band arrives as a finished `bgImage` and the mark as a `logo`, both in
`og-assets/`, both generated by the same script from the same geometry as the README banner. The
card and the banner cannot drift apart, and the docs build still needs nothing but node.

`og-assets/` sits outside `public/` for the reason `fonts/` does: these are build inputs, resolved
from the project root while the cards rasterise, and nothing ever requests them over HTTP. They are
committed, because a checkout has to be able to build the cards without regenerating the artwork,
which needs a font this repository does not carry.

Two things differ from the banner, both deliberate.

- **The card's band is opaque.** The README's is translucent so it can settle onto a light or a
  dark page, and there are only two of those and both are known. A social card is composited by
  Slack, a search engine or a chat client onto a surface nobody here can measure.
- **The orange edge is painted into the band image.** `astro-og-canvas` draws its own `border`
  before `bgImage`, so a background image hides it. The `border` option is still set, at the same
  width and colour, so the fallback path -- gradient with no image -- still gets an edge.

The header replaces the site title with the mark at `2.5rem`, with no chip behind it and in one
colour rather than two. That reduction is forced: at 40px wide the keyline scales to about a third
of a pixel, so it renders as grey haze rather than a line, and a white mark drawn by grey haze on
light paper is a ghost. `Wordmark.astro` exposes `--cw-mark-fill` and `--cw-mark-stroke` for this
one caller, which sets both to `currentColor` and gets a solid silhouette that tracks the header's
text across the toggle. They are a size reduction, not a theming hook. The visible mark is
`aria-hidden` (passing `label=""` drops its `role="img"` as well) and the link carries an
`sr-only` "Cap'n Web", so the accessible name is a word rather than a description of a picture of
a word.

Both places that use the mark wrap it in an element they own, and that is not tidiness. **A
parent's scoped styles cannot size a child component's root element.** Astro stamps the `<svg>` in
`Wordmark.astro` with *that component's* scope hash, so a `.cw-hero-mark svg { width: ... }` rule
written in `Hero.astro` compiles to a selector carrying the hero's hash and matches nothing --
silently, with the mark left at its intrinsic size. The fix is a wrapper the parent does own
(`.cw-hero-mark`, `.cw-nav-mark-box`) sized normally, with the svg filling it at `width: 100%`.
Custom properties are the exception and inherit straight through, which is why `--cw-star-size`
and `--cw-star-tilt` can be set from outside `StarBadge.astro` when a width cannot.

**The mark and the seal's fill are fixed, not themed.** They are stamped objects, and a stamp is
the same colour wherever it is stuck. White fill with a black keyline works on both schemes because
the two halves trade off: on the dark band the fill carries the mark and the keyline barely shows,
on the light band the fill vanishes into the wash and the keyline carries the whole thing. The seal
is Cloudflare orange, `#f6821f`, on both schemes.

**The seal's legend is the one exception, and it is deliberate.** It takes `--nb-background`, so
the words invert with the theme -- near-white on a light page, near-black on a dark one -- as if
the star were punched through to the paper underneath. The README banner reaches the same effect a
different way, by knocking the letters out of the star with a `<mask>` so the host page really does
show through. On dark that is 7.67:1; on light it is 2.28:1, below AA, and accepted as the cost of
pairing brand orange with an inverting label. `StarBadge.astro` carries the full note.

**The words in the seal are the `<h1>`.** They are real DOM text laid over the star, not SVG
`<text>` and not part of the artwork, so they stay selectable, translatable and searchable. That
costs some fidelity, since the reference's legend is Bookman like the rest of the mark and this
cannot be without shipping a webfont for three words; the stack asks for Bookman first and falls
back to Georgia. `text-transform` does the lower-casing so the accessible name stays a properly
capitalised sentence. The star itself is `aria-hidden`, and the lockup carries an `sr-only`
"Cap'n Web" so the page still announces its own name.

**The seal's shadow is a `drop-shadow` filter, never a `box-shadow`.** A box shadow traces the
element's border box, which would print a soft rectangle behind a twenty-pointed star; the filter
works off the rendered alpha and follows the points. It sits on `.cw-star-shape` alongside the
tilt, so the offset rotates with the star -- at a 2px offset and 11 degrees that is 0.4px of
drift, which is why the offset stays small. A larger one would need an unrotated wrapper, and the
only wrapper available also holds the legend, which should not be shadowed.

**The legend is level, and only the star is tilted.** `--cw-star-tilt` is applied to
`.cw-star-shape`, not to `.cw-star`, so it never reaches the words. The points are what should
look hand-stamped; rotating the text with them made the seal read as a sticker applied crooked
rather than as a stamp, and cost legibility on the smallest type on the page for nothing. Putting
the rotation on the child also keeps `.cw-star`'s layout box honest -- a rotated box measures
`size * (cos t + sin t)`, which silently inflated every bounding-box measurement of the seal by
17% and had to be divided back out by hand in the harnesses.

That last point had a subtlety worth recording. The `<h1>` sits on the star's orange, but nothing
in the DOM said so: a contrast checker walks up looking for a background colour, finds no paint on
an SVG sibling, and measures the text against the page. That reported 1:1 on the dark scheme and,
more dangerously, *passed* on the light one for entirely the wrong reason. `.cw-star-text`
therefore carries a `background` of the same orange it is painted on -- invisible, because the
text box is 68% of the seal wide and the star's inner radius is 81% -- purely so the measured pair
is the real one.

The headline used to be a gradient clipped to text, and that gradient was the one thing the DOM
contrast harness could never see: it reported `rgba(0,0,0,0)` and was carried as a known permanent
failure. It is gone, and the landing page now measures 0 below AA in both schemes.

### The figure is content, not decoration

`CanvasFigure.astro` mounts the `versus` scene in the flow, at full contrast, with nothing over it.
It draws two sequence diagrams on one shared 0-440ms axis: on the left four dependent calls awaited
one at a time, each paying for its own round trip and its own visit to the far end, and on the right
the same four pipelined into one trip, with the 300ms nobody spends shaded in.

The far end takes 10ms per call, on both sides, and drawing that mattered more than its size
suggests. With an instant server the picture put the entire cost of the chain on the network, which
flattered the pipelined column: it read as though the work had gone away. It has not. The same 40ms
of handler runs in both columns -- four separate visits on the left, back to back on the right --
and what pipelining removes is only the waiting in between. Ten milliseconds is seven pixels of a
306px axis, so the scene draws the handler as a solid cap on the server rail; seven pixels of plain
nothing between an arriving line and a departing one reads as a rendering fault rather than as time
passing.

Three rules follow from it being content rather than texture, and all three are the opposite of what
a backdrop wants.

- **The text is type, so it is measured like type.** The verdicts carry the numbers the docs use --
  four dependent calls costing four round trips and 440ms against one round trip and 140ms -- set in
  `--nb-foreground` and `--nb-muted-foreground` at 11-14px with **no `globalAlpha` dimming at all**.
  The first pass did dim them, and `fig-contrast.mjs` caught four label classes at 3.48-4.36:1 in
  light: the `opacity`-as-hierarchy sin, committed against text already chosen for its contrast.
  Everything now clears 4.5:1 in both schemes. Remaining alpha in the scene is on strokes and fills,
  where the 3:1 rule applies.
- **A canvas needs words.** The figure is a `<figure>` with an `sr-only` `<figcaption>`, and
  `CanvasFigure` requires the caption as a prop. The text lives in `lib/hero-copy.ts` beside the
  headline, because the numbers in it are the numbers the scene draws and nothing checks that they
  still agree. A canvas is an empty element to a screen reader, and the DOM contrast harness cannot
  see into one either, which is why the hero title reports `rgba(0,0,0,0)`.
- **The reduced-motion still has to carry the whole argument**, not a representative moment. It
  freezes mid-hold rather than at the instant the last reply lands, because the verdicts fade in
  over 25ms of story time: frozen at `TOTAL_MS` exactly, the slow lane's "4 round trips" was painted
  at
  `globalAlpha` 0 and the still lost the one number it exists to show. No screenshot diff would
  catch that, so `still-text.mjs` asserts on draw calls -- both verdicts visible at every width, the
  saved band wherever it fits, and nothing painted at alpha 0.

One wire label, at the far end: `batched request`. There was a second one, `pipeline`, against the
client rail the pushes leave from, and it was saying what the column header, the four converging
lines and the verdict underneath already said. The arrival is the half of the claim that is not
obvious from the picture -- that one thing crossed and the far end had everything it needed -- so
that is the half that gets words. Dropping it is not a contradiction of "1 round trip" either: a
pipelined batch really is four `push` messages in one body, and what there is only one of is the
trip.

The scene's clock is in milliseconds of story, and used to be in "legs", where a leg was one
crossing and everything else was a fraction of one. That was fine while the far end answered
instantly and stopped being fine the moment it did not: 10ms is a fifth of a leg, and a model that
can only count crossings cannot place it. `yAt` is now the only thing that knows how tall a
millisecond is.

### Laying it out

The time axis stands **between** the two diagrams rather than to the left of both. That is not where
a y-axis normally goes, and it is the point: this axis is not either panel's scale, it is the single
shared clock that makes the two readable against each other. It also fixes the composition, because
an axis on the left is the outermost ink on the figure with nothing answering it on the right, and
no amount of centring the panels among themselves corrects for an element that exists on one side
only. The ticks cross the line rather than stopping at it, for the same reason.

That choice deleted more arithmetic than it added. There is no panel box: each diagram is placed
`AXIS_HALF` from the axis and `RAIL_HALF * 2` wide, so the pair is a mirror about the centre at
every width and the outer margins come out equal without being computed. Measured skew between them
is 0px from 360 to 1920. Two earlier attempts at balance -- tiling the width into panels and pulling
them together, then mirroring the axis column as right-hand margin -- were both corrections for a
layout that was asymmetric by construction, and both went away with it.

Detail sheds in the order that keeps the argument last: the method names go below 900px, the axis
and the "300 ms saved" band below 600px, and both verdicts survive to 360px. What is shown is
decided from measured label budgets, not width breakpoints -- the first cut keyed off `panelW < 240`
and ran the call labels straight through the `200` tick at 900px.

Sizes are derived from the strings, so they move when the copy does, and `AXIS_HALF` is the one that
keeps proving it. It was 104 while the fast panel's client rail read "one message", 88 when that was
shortened to "pipeline", and 56 now the label is gone and the binding constraint is the other side
of the column: the slow panel's "server" rail label with the tick numbers reaching back towards it.
That last step took another 64px of dead space out of the middle of the figure. It is computed from
those two measurements rather than typed, because all three of the earlier values were numbers
somebody measured once and then left behind.

### The harness

`canvas-hero.client.ts` owns everything that is not drawing: the device pixel ratio, capped at 2 so
a 3x phone does not rasterize nine times the pixels for no visible gain; an accumulated clock, so
parking the loop pauses the story instead of fast-forwarding it; `Resize`- and
`IntersectionObserver`; `visibilitychange`; and a `MutationObserver` on `data-theme` that repaints
even while parked, so a scheme flip is never stale. It repaints once more when the webfonts land,
because canvas text is rasterized at draw time with no reflow behind it, so a frame painted before
the swap keeps its fallback font for as long as it is on screen -- and under reduced motion that is
one frame, forever.

It also refuses to mount twice on a container it has already claimed. The figure once shipped drawn
twice, one copy over the other, which is invisible on an opaque scene and obvious the moment
anything is translucent.

Unlike the WebGL hero it replaced, reduced motion still gets a canvas here, holding one composed
frame. A still diagram is not a motion problem, and an empty hero is worse.

### What used to be here

This hero was picked by building fourteen of them. Routes `/1` to `/9` were the landing page with a
different animation each, judged side by side and then deleted: thirteen scenes, a shared node
field, a lane stage, a text-fitting helper, a scene registry, and the `KeepOut` system that measured
the hero's real content boxes so a backdrop could lay itself out in the clear space beside the copy.
`git log` has all of it. None of it survives, because a foreground figure in its own box has nothing
to avoid, and the one scene left ignored every coordinate that machinery produced.

The WebGL hero went the same way. `NetworkHero.astro`, `LightTunnel.astro` and
`light-tunnel.client.ts` were a vanilla port of React Bits' LightTunnel drawn twice by one shader,
once emissive for the dark stage and once as ink so it could dissolve into a light page instead of
sitting in a hard-edged dark band. It was also the only expensive thing the site shipped: 56.4 kB of
`ogl`, on the page that gets the most first-time traffic. Once the figure moved to the foreground it
was a second animation competing with the thing the page is actually arguing, and `Hero.astro`'s
static import kept pulling it into the bundle even after nothing rendered it. The dependency is
gone.

The result is a landing page that ships **19.0 kB of JavaScript uncompressed**, 7.1 kB of which is
the figure and its harness, against 62.7 kB before.

### The bento figures

`Features.astro` draws the bento figures as SVG line art in `--cw-art-stroke`, at a dozen different
stroke opacities, which is a technique that assumes a dark stage: a 0.13-alpha stroke over near-black
is a visible hairline, and the same stroke over `#eef1f4` is nothing. Measured per figure, the light
scheme was running at 1.12--1.76:1 mean contrast, and the globe -- whose wires were hardcoded blues
rather than tokens -- peaked at **1.37:1**, which is invisible. Every opacity went up, the base
stroke went from 1 to 1.15, the globe's colours became `--cw-art-stroke-rgb`, and the light stroke
deepened to `#253c6d`. That puts the figures at 1.26--2.17:1 mean and 4.98--9.64:1 peak. Mean stays
low on purpose: these are line drawings on a large empty field, so most of the box is background and
what matters is the contrast of the strokes themselves.

## Social cards

Every page gets its own Open Graph image at `/og/<slug>.png`, generated at build time by
`astro-og-canvas` through the routes the scaffold provides. The card's whole visual definition is
`src/pages/og/_og-card-config.ts`: the site's dark scheme, and a 12px Cloudflare orange border on
the leading edge, which is the one thing that makes one recognisable at thumbnail size. The cards are
still set in Inter, which the site itself no longer uses -- they are rasterized, so the face is a
build input rather than something a reader downloads.

There used to be a hand-written pipeline here: a seeded SVG rendering of the node field the site had
at the time, laid out with Satori and rasterized with resvg, plus a subset of Inter and a script to
build it. It came to about seven hundred lines to produce a nicer picture than the framework's, and
it was deleted during the port. The framework's cards are worse and are one config object, and
social cards are not where this site earns anything.

Two things worth knowing:

**The font is build-time only, and is deliberately not in `public/`.** `astro-og-canvas` resolves
font paths from the project root when it rasterizes, so `fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf` works and is never
served. Left where the starter puts it, that is 420 kB copied into `dist/` and deployed for no
reader. The rendered cards are byte-identical either way.

**Absolute URLs come from `site`.** Open Graph needs an absolute `og:image`. `astro.config.ts`
defaults `site` to the preview deployment so the tags are valid today; set `DOCS_SITE_URL` once a
canonical domain exists.

## The example playgrounds

The `/examples/*` pages are laid out like a code playground: the real source on the left, the demo
running on the right, filling most of the viewport. `src/examples.ts` is the single list of
examples, read by both the pages and the bundler.

### Nothing is running on a server

There is no backend. `scripts/build-playgrounds.mjs` bundles each example's **own Worker** into the
page beside its **own client**, and installs a `fetch` shim that hands requests for the RPC path
straight to the Worker's `fetch` handler:

```js
globalThis.fetch = async (input, init) => {
  const request = new Request(input, init);
  if (new URL(request.url).pathname === RPC_PATH) {
    return await worker.fetch(request, ENV, ctx);
  }
  return upstream(input, init);
};
```

Everything above that line is the genuine code path: the same session setup, the same batch
encoding, the same `newWorkersRpcResponse` answering. So the round-trip counts the demos print are
real, and the whole site still deploys as static assets. `newWorkersRpcResponse` is safe to run in a
browser because its POST branch is just the HTTP batch path; only the WebSocket-upgrade branch
touches `WebSocketPair`, and the shim never routes an upgrade to it.

Output lands in `public/playground/<slug>/` and is gitignored. `predev` and `prebuild` regenerate
it, so it cannot go stale, but note it bundles the library's **build output**, so a change to
`src/` needs `npm run build` at the repo root before it reaches a playground.

The iframe points at `/playground/<slug>/index.html`, spelled out in full. Astro's dev server does
not resolve a directory request under `public/` to its index, so the tidier-looking
`/playground/<slug>/` is a 404 in dev even though most static hosts, including Cloudflare's asset
handling, would serve it. The path is derived from the slug in `examples.ts` so it cannot drift
from where the bundler writes.

Worth knowing when verifying this: **a production build served by any ordinary static file server
will hide that class of bug**, because directory-index resolution is a property of the host. Check
`astro dev` too.

Details worth keeping:

- **The Worker's `env` is read from the example's `wrangler.jsonc` `vars`**, so the playground runs
  with the same delays as a real deployment rather than a second copy of those numbers drifting
  over here. That is the only reason there is a JSONC parser in the script.
- **`capnweb-validate` codegen runs during bundling.** `@validateRpc()` is a build-time transform;
  bundle without the plugin and the example silently loses the validation it is demonstrating. The
  React playground's "Test validation failure" button is the check that it did run.
- **Specifiers are resolved by an `onResolve` hook, not the examples' tsconfig `paths`**, which
  point at `.d.ts` files that esbuild would try to bundle.
- **One copy of the library per page.** `capnweb` is marked external and rewritten to a sibling
  `vendor/capnweb.js` that the client and the Worker share.

### The source panes

**The code is read from the real files at build time.** `src/lib/source.ts` reads each path from the
repo, so the source on the site cannot drift from the code that ships. A moved or renamed file is a
build error, not a silently empty tab; that is the whole point, so please keep it that way rather
than catching the error.

**Whole files only.** There is no mechanism for showing an excerpt, and that is deliberate: an
excerpt is a claim that the rest does not matter, and the reader has no way to check it. Line
numbers drift silently the moment anything above them changes, and named regions turn out to be a
way of leaving a file badly organised while making its docs tab look tidy.

So when a file is too long or too mixed to show, the fix is to split the file. Each example keeps
its RPC code in a module of its own (`demo.js`, `runs.ts`, `session.js`) with the DOM wiring
somewhere else. That is better code regardless of the docs, which is the point.

Finding the repo root is done by walking up to sentinel files rather than counting `..` segments,
because for a production build this code is bundled into `dist/.prerender/chunks/` and any fixed
offset silently breaks.

### Layout and theme

The stage needs the full width of the main column but prose does not, so the component widens
`--nb-content-max` to `100%` and caps everything that is *not* the stage at `47rem`. That keeps
left edges aligned with the page title, and avoids trying to break a centred column out past a
sidebar whose width would have to be guessed at. Below `60rem` the two panes stack, demo first.

Both of those rules are guarded by `:root:has(.capn-stage)`, and the guard is load-bearing rather
than decorative: `is:global` styles are hoisted into the route's shared stylesheet, so every page
built by `[...slug].astro` loads them. Unguarded, the prose cap applied to the landing page.

Because the demo is served from this same site it is **same-origin**, which buys two things: the
iframe `src` is server-rendered (so the code is still readable with JavaScript off) and the embedded
page reads the docs theme straight off `parent.document` before first paint, so there is no flash
and no theme in the URL. Later toggles are pushed over `postMessage`, so the frame never reloads.
Each demo applies the result with `color-scheme`, which is why they use `light-dark()` rather than a
`prefers-color-scheme` media query, and each hides its own header when embedded.

The stage's own chrome deliberately does **not** use the site palette. It is meant to read as an
editor, so `Playground.astro` defines a small local palette. `--pg-bg` is the editor body: the stage
paints it and the code block inside is stripped back to transparent, so the active tab and the code
below it are the same fill by construction, which is what makes the tab strip look attached rather
than stuck on top. The tab strip and the preview toolbar are both `2.25rem` so the two panes line up.

Stripping that code block back is four rules against Nimbus's `.nb-code-figure`, and getting them
wrong is not a cosmetic failure. The figure has to become the pane's flex column, and the `<pre>`
inside it has to be the element that scrolls; as it comes out of the framework the figure clips the
file at the pane's height and the rest of it is unreachable, which is how the port shipped for a
while. The language badge is suppressed in here too: the tab above already names the file.

The demos keep their own visual identity (the React one is Cloudflare orange) on purpose. The
toolbar above the frame is the boundary; making them look like docs widgets would undercut the point
that these are real apps. What they should *not* keep is their own page chrome: the React app's 5px
brand stripe is `display: none` under `[data-embedded]`, alongside its `h1`, because framed it just
reads as a stray line under the toolbar.

Per-file explanations are `title` tooltips on the tabs rather than a visible strip of prose, which
keeps the pane looking like an editor. The text still lives in `examples.ts`.

`public/playground` is excluded in `tsconfig.json`; without that, `astro check` type-checks the
bundled vendor output and reports ~200 hints from it.

### Adding an example

An entry in `src/examples.ts` (both the `files` list and the `build` block) and a page under
`src/content/docs/examples/`. The sidebar picks it up from the directory; `sidebar.order` in the
page's frontmatter decides where in the group it lands.

## Traps worth knowing about

**The markdown pipeline is not remark.** Nimbus compiles markdown with Sätteri, whose plugins are
visitor objects keyed by node type, over read-only nodes, writing through `context.setProperty`.
Passing remark plugins to `mdx({ remarkPlugins })` does not error; they are silently dropped. Also
note that a Sätteri plugin cannot mutate `attributes` on an `mdxJsxFlowElement`: the op stream has
no encoding for it and the write throws. An MDX page can import and interpolate instead, which is
what `index.mdx` does.

**A PascalCase tag in MDX must be registered.** `src/components.ts` is the registry, a pre-build
validator reads it, and an unregistered tag fails the build with a "did you mean" hint. This is a
good failure mode and worth knowing before it looks like a resolution bug.

**`getDocsStaticPaths` uses the entry id verbatim**, so `docs/index.mdx` would be served at
`/index`. `[...slug].astro` maps that one id to the root, as Nimbus's own site does, and the
markdown twin route needs the same mapping or the home page's "view as markdown" link 404s.

**Icons come from Nimbus, not `astro-icon`.** The registry's `link-card` imports
`astro-icon/components`, which is not a dependency of `nimbus-docs` or of the starter.
`@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/components/Icon.astro` is a documented drop-in and accepts `is:inline`.

**A selector that matches nothing is a bug you cannot see.** The playground's source pane kept
styling Expressive Code for a while after Nimbus replaced it with Shiki: the rules parsed, applied to
nothing, and the pane looked plausible from the top while everything below the first screen of each
file was unreachable, which on the longest example was 4,600 pixels of source. Sweeping every rule in
every stylesheet against every page and reporting the ones that never match found it in one pass, and
is worth repeating after any framework change.

## Deployment

The site is `https://capnweb.com`, served from a Cloudflare Worker named `capnweb-docs` in the
`capnweb` account. Every push to `main` redeploys it: `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` builds the
library, builds the site, and runs `wrangler deploy`. The same build runs as a `build-docs` job on
every pull request, so a site that does not build fails the PR rather than the deploy, and every
pull request from a branch in this repo also gets its own live copy -- see "Previews" below.

`npm run build` emits a plain static site to `dist/`, deployable anywhere. `site` is
`https://capnweb.com` unless `DOCS_SITE_URL` overrides it, and it is what canonical URLs, the
absolute OG image URLs, `robots.txt`, the sitemap and the links inside `/llms.txt` are all built
from -- which is why a preview build has to override it rather than publish a sitemap claiming to be
production:

```sh
DOCS_SITE_URL=https://example.com npm run build
```

`wrangler.jsonc` deploys that output to a Cloudflare Worker. There is no `main`, so no Worker script
runs: every request is served from the asset store, which is all a static site with in-browser
playgrounds needs. Deploy by hand from the **repo root**, not from here -- the playgrounds vendor
`dist/index.js` and the prose substitutes the measured bundle size, so the library has to be built
first and only the root script does both:

```sh
npm run deploy:docs   # at the repo root: library build, then site build, then wrangler deploy
```

`public/_headers` is part of the deployment rather than decoration. Workers' default for static
assets is `must-revalidate`, and a response that must be revalidated cannot be served from cache, so
the page Astro had already prefetched on hover was thrown away and refetched on the click. The
stylesheet, revalidated but answered with a 304, arrived first, and that gap was a frame of styled
header over bare background between navigations. The file gives documents a minute of freshness and
fingerprinted assets a year.

`account_id` is committed in `wrangler.jsonc` rather than left to `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`. It is an
identifier, not a credential, and pinning it is what stops a deploy from an operator who can see
several accounts landing in the wrong one -- wrangler refuses to guess and fails the deploy instead.

`workers_dev` and top-level `preview_urls` are both off. Both would put a second origin on
`*.workers.dev`, and every URL the build emits already names `https://capnweb.com`, so a live
workers.dev copy is a duplicate for crawlers and a link people paste by accident. Previews get a
hostname a different way: a second custom-domain route on `pr.capnweb.com` with `enabled: false`
and `previews_enabled: true`. That keeps the bare `pr.capnweb.com` dark and routes
`<name>.pr.capnweb.com` to the matching Preview. Without `previews_enabled`, `wrangler preview`
still succeeds and still returns a Preview -- with an empty `urls` array, which is a deploy nobody
can look at. Routes are applied by `wrangler deploy`, not by `wrangler preview`, so a production
deploy is what turns the switch on.

## Previews

Every pull request from a branch in this repo gets its own copy of the site at
`https://<number>.pr.capnweb.com`, posted as a comment on the pull request and deleted when it
closes. `.github/workflows/preview-docs.yml` uses Worker Previews (`wrangler preview`) rather than
`wrangler deploy`, against the same Worker, so a Preview is a branch of `capnweb-docs` rather than a
second Worker to operate.

Two details are load-bearing:

- **The Preview URL is known before deployment.** The site bakes its origin into canonicals, OG
  URLs, `robots.txt` and the sitemap, so `DOCS_SITE_URL` must be set before `astro build`. The
  workflow checks Wrangler's returned URL against that origin before posting the Preview.
- **`X-Robots-Tag: noindex` is appended to `dist/_headers`, not committed to `public/_headers`.** A
  Preview URL is public and this repo is public, so the pull request comment is a crawlable link to
  it. It is a header rather than a `Disallow` in `robots.txt` because disallowing the crawl would
  stop a crawler ever reading the `noindex` -- which is how staging sites end up indexed as bare
  URLs regardless. Committing it is not an option: that file ships to production too.

Fork pull requests do not get a Preview. A `pull_request` run from a fork has no access to secrets,
and `pull_request_target`, which would give it them, would be handing a contributor's build scripts
a credential that can deploy the real site. They are still built by `build-docs` in `test.yml`.

Previews are capped per Worker, and Cloudflare evicts the least recently deployed one at the cap, so
the cleanup job is hygiene rather than a hard requirement. Locally, `wrangler preview --name <name>`
does the same thing by hand; `wrangler preview delete --name <name>` removes it. Note that `--name`
is a flag on both, not a positional -- the positional is the entry point script.

Previews need a `wrangler` new enough to have the command, which is why the root pins 4.125.0. There
is no `previews` block in `wrangler.jsonc` and there should not need to be: this Worker has no
bindings, and the settings a static site does care about -- `assets`, `compatibility_date` -- are
read from the top level for Previews too. If this site ever gains a binding, note that Previews do
**not** inherit bindings from the top level; each one has to be declared under `previews`.
