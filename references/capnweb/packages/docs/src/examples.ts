 *
 *   - the playground pages, which read `files` to show the source, and
 *   - `scripts/build-playgrounds.mjs`, which reads `build` to bundle each
 *     example into a self-contained page that runs in an iframe.
 *
 * There is no server behind the playgrounds. Each one bundles the example's
 * real Worker into the page alongside its real client, and routes the client's
 * `fetch` of `rpcPath` straight into that Worker's `fetch` handler. The wire
 * format is the genuine HTTP batch protocol, so the request counts the demos
 * report are real -- there is simply no network under them. That is what lets
 * the whole site deploy as static assets.
