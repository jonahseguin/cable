Cap'n Web is a spiritual sibling to [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org) (and is created by the
same author), but designed to play nice in the web stack. That means:

- Like Cap'n Proto, it is an **object-capability protocol**. ("Cap'n" is short for "capabilities
  and", making this *capabilities and the web*. The nautical breakfast-cereal overtones are
  inherited from Cap'n Proto, which bills itself as a "cerealization protocol", and are entirely
  deliberate.) Possession of a stub is itself the authority to use it, which is what
  [Security](/guides/security/) builds on.
- Unlike Cap'n Proto, Cap'n Web has **no schemas**. In fact, it has almost no boilerplate
  whatsoever. This means it works more like the
  [JavaScript-native RPC system in Cloudflare Workers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/javascript-native-rpc/).
- That said, it integrates nicely with TypeScript.
- Also unlike Cap'n Proto, Cap'n Web's underlying serialization is **human-readable**. It's just
  JSON, with a little pre- and post-processing.
- It works over HTTP, WebSocket, and `postMessage()` out of the box, and can be extended to other
  transports easily.
- It works in all major browsers, Cloudflare Workers, Node.js, Bun, Deno, and other modern
  JavaScript runtimes.

The whole thing compresses (minify + gzip) to **%BUNDLE_SIZE% with no dependencies**.

## Why object-capability RPC

Cap'n Web is more expressive than almost every other RPC system, because it implements an
object-capability RPC model. That means it:

- **Supports bidirectional calling.** The client can call the server, and the server can also call
  the client.
- **Supports passing functions by reference.** If you pass a function over RPC, the recipient
  receives a "stub". When they call the stub, they actually make an RPC back to you, invoking the
  function where it was created. This is how bidirectional calling happens: the client passes a
  callback to the server, and then the server can call it later.
- **Supports passing objects by reference.** If a class extends the special marker type
  [`RpcTarget`](/concepts/rpc-target/), then instances of that class are passed by reference, with
  method calls calling back to the location where the object was created.
- **Supports promise pipelining.** When you start an RPC, you get back a promise. Instead of
  awaiting it, you can immediately use the promise in dependent RPCs, thus performing a chain of
  calls in a single network round trip.
- **Supports capability-based security patterns.** Holding a reference *is* the permission to use
  it, which makes authorization patterns fall out naturally.

## How it compares

|                     | Cap'n Web             | Cap'n Proto              |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Schemas             | None                  | `.capnp` schema language |
| Codegen             | None                  | Required                 |
| Serialization       | JSON (human-readable) | Binary, zero-copy        |
| Object capabilities | Yes                   | Yes                      |
| Promise pipelining  | Yes                   | Yes                      |
| Primary home        | The web stack         | C++ and systems software |

Cap'n Web is *not* a port of Cap'n Proto, and the two do not interoperate on the wire. They share
a model, an author, and a sense of humour.

For how Cap'n Web stacks up against tRPC, JSON-RPC, GraphQL and the older distributed-object
systems, see [How it compares](/guides/comparisons/).

## A protocol, or a library?

Both, and the two are worth keeping apart.

The `capnweb` npm package is an implementation. The [wire protocol](/reference/protocol/) is a
specification, and you can write your own peer against it. The protocol is JavaScript-flavoured to
about the same extent JSON is (its value types are the JavaScript built-ins), but nothing in the
framing or the expression language demands a JavaScript implementation.

The *library*, on the other hand, is deliberately scoped to JavaScript and TypeScript. If your
backend is written in something else, Cap'n Proto is the answer today; see
[using Cap'n Web from other languages](/guides/comparisons/#vs-capn-proto-and-using-capn-web-from-other-languages).

## Where to next

- [Installation](/start/installation/): one npm package, no build step.
- [Quickstart](/start/quickstart/): a working client and server.
- [Pipelining tour](/start/pipelining-tour/): the part that makes it fast.
- [How it compares](/guides/comparisons/): against the alternatives, including the honest gaps.
