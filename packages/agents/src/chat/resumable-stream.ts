/**
 * ResumableStream: chat's producer-side coalescing and wire-protocol replay
 * adapter over the `agents/streams` capability. Chat's in-flight output
 * lives in the shared durable chunk log (`cf_agents_streams` /
 * `cf_agents_stream_chunks`), one stream per turn, tagged with the turn's
 * request id so replay-by-request rides the capability's indexed lookup.
 *
 * Handles:
 * - Chunk buffering (packed segments — batched writes for storage-op economy)
 * - Stream lifecycle (start, complete, error) mapped onto Streams settlement
 * - Chunk replay for reconnecting clients (framing in `replay-frames.ts`)
 * - Stale stream cleanup (row-level retention; at most one indexed
 *   chunk-tail read per stale live candidate, never a chunk-table scan)
 * - Active stream restoration after agent restart
 * - One-time migration of legacy `cf_ai_chat_stream_*` tables
 *
 * The adapter's public surface is synchronous and may be constructed before
 * the Lifecycle starts, so it runs on the Streams internal sync aperture; the
 * invariant-bearing writes (append fence, settlement, wakeups, events) go
 * through the capability, so live `streams.read()` consumers and diagnostics
 * observe chat streams like any other stream. The host `sql` handle is used
 * only for chat's own legacy tables during migration.
