# y-partyserver

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#378](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/378) [`f3ab44f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/f3ab44f7c095a68df909911b2430eac9cf48229c) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Use native `ctx.id.name` to populate `this.name`.

  Durable Objects now expose `ctx.id.name` on every entry point (constructor, fetch, alarm, hibernating websocket handlers) when the DO is addressed via `idFromName()`/`getByName()`. PartyServer now uses this as the primary source of `this.name`, which simplifies routing, eliminates storage writes, and makes `this.name` available inside the constructor.

  Changes in `partyserver`:
  - `this.name` resolves from `this.ctx.id.name`. The apologetic `workerd#2240` error message is gone.
  - `this.name` is now available **inside the constructor** and from class field initializers, not just after `setName()`/`fetch()` has run.
  - `routePartykitRequest` no longer issues a `setName()`/`_initAndFetch()` RPC before `fetch()`. The WebSocket path goes from 2 RPCs to 1; the HTTP path remains 1 RPC. Props, when supplied, are delivered to the DO via the `x-partykit-props` request header, set after `onBeforeConnect`/`onBeforeRequest` hooks run.
  - `getServerByName` continues to perform a single RPC to ensure `onStart()` has completed before returning, so user-defined RPC methods on the returned stub can rely on initialization being done. That RPC is now cheaper internally (no storage write; name is read from `ctx.id.name`).
  - `Server` no longer writes the `__ps_name` record to storage. Existing records remain on disk for backward compatibility and are only read inside `alarm()` as a fallback for alarms that were scheduled before 2026-03-15 (where `ctx.id.name` is not carried into the alarm handler — see the [Durable Objects ID docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/id/#name)).
  - `setName()` and `_initAndFetch()` are marked `@deprecated`. They continue to work for backward compatibility. `setName(name)` now throws if `name` does not match `ctx.id.name`.
  - The `x-partykit-room` header is still accepted as a fallback when `ctx.id.name` is not available.
  - Error message when the name cannot be resolved has been rewritten to list the three real causes (unsupported addressing via `idFromString()`/`newUniqueId()`, runtime too old to expose `ctx.id.name`, or direct `stub.fetch()` without `routePartykitRequest`/`getServerByName`).
  - When reading `this.name` throws, it is because `ctx.id.name` is undefined and no legacy fallback has populated the name: the DO was addressed via `idFromString()` or `newUniqueId()` (both unsupported), the runtime is too old to expose `ctx.id.name`, or a pre-2026-03-15 alarm fired before the legacy storage fallback ran.

  Changes in all affected packages (`partyserver`, `partysub`, `partysync`, `y-partyserver`, `hono-party`):
  - `@cloudflare/workers-types` peer dependency bumped from `^4.20240729.0` to `^4.20260424.1`. The old range predates `ctx.id.name` in the type surface.

  Not supported: addressing PartyServer DOs via `idFromString()` or `newUniqueId()`. These paths return `ctx.id.name === undefined` inside the DO and will surface as a clear error from `this.name`. PartyServer has always assumed name-based addressing via `getServerByName` / `routePartykitRequest`; this release makes that assumption explicit.

## 2.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [#368](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/368) [`c0da6f4`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/c0da6f4ff753bff652ac576784ad024335a2b750) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix params() not being re-evaluated on WebSocket reconnect

  When `params` was passed as a function to `YProvider`, it was only evaluated on the initial connection. On automatic reconnects (e.g. after a network drop), the params function was not called again, causing dynamic values like auth tokens to go stale.

  The reconnection path now goes through an overridable `_reconnectWS()` method that `YProvider` uses to re-resolve params before re-establishing the WebSocket.

## 2.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [#348](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/348) [`37ca0cd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/37ca0cde8c8e6e43cf2dea6e2dab4b39c0532bec) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Extract Yjs functionality into a `withYjs` mixin that can be applied to any Server subclass. `YServer` is now `withYjs(Server)`.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#341](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/341) [`e7f4b51`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/e7f4b51198904273befb1d39478840c628f6e2b1) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix Yjs hibernation support and awareness propagation

  **Server:**
  - Replace in-memory `WSSharedDoc.conns` Map with `connection.setState()` and `getConnections()` so connection tracking survives Durable Object hibernation
  - Move event handler registration from `WSSharedDoc` constructor into `onStart()` to use `getConnections()` for broadcasting
  - Disable awareness protocol's built-in `_checkInterval` in `WSSharedDoc` constructor to prevent timers from defeating hibernation
  - On `onStart`, send sync step 1 to all existing connections so clients re-sync the server's document after hibernation wake-up
  - Simplify `send()` — no longer forcibly closes connections on failure
  - Remove `closeConn()` helper; awareness cleanup now happens in `onClose` via persisted connection state
  - Widen `onLoad()` return type to `Promise<YDoc | void>` to allow seeding the document from a returned YDoc

  **Provider:**
  - Switch awareness event listener from `"update"` to `"change"` so clock-only heartbeat renewals do not produce network traffic (allows DO hibernation during idle sessions)
  - Disable awareness protocol's built-in `_checkInterval` on the client to stop 15-second clock renewals and 30-second peer timeout removal
  - Remove provider's own `_checkInterval` liveness timer (was coupled to the awareness heartbeat)
  - Clear stale awareness meta for remote clients on WebSocket close so reconnecting clients' awareness updates are accepted
  - Bump awareness clock on reconnect to ensure remote peers accept the update
  - Fix bug where `host.slice(0, -1)` result was not assigned, so trailing slashes were never stripped
