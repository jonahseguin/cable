# partysocket

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#409](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/409) [`6b97742`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/6b977426fcaac8a2b4265085029dd2e0b813af2e) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add `shouldReconnectOnClose`, allowing callers to stop automatic reconnects for terminal close events while preserving the existing reconnect-by-default behavior.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#403](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/403) [`7e042eb`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/7e042ebeb2e2796a76079a102f8d95ad07e39946) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Make buffered messages and connection teardown reliable across socket replacement and explicit close (see cloudflare/agents#1738).
  - **`close()` now dispatches its `close` event synchronously** (mirroring how `reconnect()` already dispatched its synthetic close). Consumers that detach their listeners right after closing — like the React hooks during cleanup — previously never observed the terminal close event, leaving "connection closed" handling (pending-call rejection, state resets) to never run. After `close()` returns, `readyState` reports `CLOSED` immediately, even while the underlying socket finishes its closing handshake. Code that attached a `close` listener _after_ calling `close()` and relied on the event arriving asynchronously must attach the listener first.
  - **`send()` now returns a `boolean`**: `true` if the message was transmitted immediately over an open connection, `false` if it was buffered (delivered when the connection next opens, always before the `open` event is dispatched) or dropped because `maxEnqueuedMessages` was reached. Callers implementing request/response protocols can use this to know whether a request is actually in flight.
  - **New `drainQueuedMessages()` method** removes and returns all messages that were buffered by `send()` but never transmitted, so a socket that's being discarded can hand its unsent buffer to a replacement instead of silently losing it.
  - **React hooks (`usePartySocket`, `useWebSocket`) now migrate buffered messages when they replace the socket** because connection options changed. By default, buffered messages transfer only when the destination is unchanged (e.g. only `query` — credentials — changed); if destination options (`room`, `party`, `path`, `host`, URL, ...) changed, the messages are discarded with a warning rather than delivered to a destination they weren't composed for. The new `transferEnqueuedMessages` option overrides this: `true` always transfers, `false` never does.
  - **Warn when `send()` is called after `close()`.** Messages sent against a permanently closed socket are buffered into a queue that nothing will ever flush (unless `reconnect()` is called later), which silently strands the message — and any caller waiting on a reply. This usually indicates a stale socket reference in the caller. The message is still buffered for backwards compatibility; the warning is emitted once per close cycle and resets on `reconnect()`.

## 1.1.19

### Patch Changes

- [#397](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/397) [`798aae5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/798aae5053d0e482e4aaa65e0efe0633e0d07b8c) Thanks [@agcty](https://github.com/agcty)! - fix(partysocket): avoid module-scope random default

## 1.1.18

### Patch Changes

- [#374](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/374) [`c05d86a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/c05d86af9b70af41bd47fbb127acdecc3cacd2cf) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Narrow the exported `Message` type from `ArrayBufferView` to `ArrayBufferView<ArrayBuffer>` so it matches the DOM `WebSocket.send()` overloads under newer `@cloudflare/workers-types` / lib.dom.d.ts, where the default `ArrayBufferView<ArrayBufferLike>` includes `SharedArrayBuffer`-backed views that `send()` does not accept. Runtime behaviour is unchanged — `WebSocket.send()` already rejected shared-buffer views at runtime.

## 1.1.17

### Patch Changes

- [#372](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/372) [`bb6ab6f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/bb6ab6f736ad78fa2108c4e43d1f2250e670c302) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix `protocols` type in `PartySocketOptions` to accept `ProtocolsProvider` instead of `string[]`, matching the full range of types already supported by the underlying `ReconnectingWebSocket`.

## 1.1.16

### Patch Changes

- [#343](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/343) [`c59d33d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/c59d33d3296983e94a51126cf5bdb650679bb002) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - update deps

## 1.1.15

### Patch Changes

- [#340](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/340) [`122376f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/122376fa935ae8d8f4997981d4cc95ace0851daf) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Declare `react` as an optional peer dependency so strict package managers like pnpm correctly resolve it for the `partysocket/react` and `partysocket/use-ws` subpath exports.

## 1.1.14

### Patch Changes

- [#335](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/335) [`659ceda`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/659cedafd67d0b8d10bbea5280c6e06a68564335) Thanks [@deathbyknowledge](https://github.com/deathbyknowledge)! - Fix useStableSocket replacing socket on HMR/StrictMode effect re-runs. When Vite HMR fires, React Fast Refresh re-runs all effects — the old code unconditionally created a new socket, breaking downstream references (event listeners, \_pk identity, etc.). Now detects whether connection options actually changed via referential equality on the memoized options object: if unchanged (HMR), calls `socket.reconnect()` to preserve identity; if changed, creates a new socket as before.

## 1.1.13

### Patch Changes

- [#322](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/322) [`3ed3bf0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/3ed3bf003972b29bbe9194fedcde6bf729d5af14) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix `reconnect()` not working after `maxRetries` has been exhausted. The `_connectLock` was not released when the max retries early return was hit in `_connect()`, preventing any subsequent `reconnect()` call from initiating a new connection.

## 1.1.12

### Patch Changes

- [#317](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/317) [`e1e7b47`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/e1e7b47d87a5dd9cd102f995d4b58ab8d03441ba) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix `PartySocket.reconnect()` crashing when using `basePath` without `room`. The reconnect guard now accepts either `room` or `basePath` as sufficient context to construct a connection URL.

- [#319](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/319) [`15a4157`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/15a41572a778526b496de94d5ef0909226c56e72) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Throw a clear error when constructing a `PartySocket` without `room` or `basePath` (and without `startClosed: true`), instead of silently connecting to a malformed URL containing `"undefined"` as the room name.

## 1.1.11

### Patch Changes

- [#315](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/315) [`2a2928b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/2a2928b016c01dbcd6a2eb76b973d41bdd0ad1fc) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add `enabled` prop to `usePartySocket` and `useWebSocket` hooks for conditional connection control

- [#294](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/pull/294) [`8237982`](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit/commit/8237982c1ed97b20b98c73d288ab62a927a83b0b) Thanks [@amondnet](https://github.com/amondnet)! - Fix React Native/Expo `dispatchEvent` TypeError

  Added React Native environment detection to use Node-style event cloning. React Native/Expo environments have both `process` and `document` polyfilled but not `process.versions.node`, which caused browser-style event cloning to be selected incorrectly. Browser-style cloning produces events that fail `instanceof Event` checks in `event-target-polyfill`.

  Fixes #257

  renamed the previous prefix option to basePath, and added a new prefix option.

  This is a breaking change, but since this was an undocumented feature, it's unlikely to affect anyone.

  We currently assume that parties are routed to by /parties/:party/:room (or /party/:room for the default party.) However, there will be upcoming changes where parties can be routed to on the basis of any url (or even any other param, like a session id or whatever). This change lets clients connect with a `prefix` param. It also uses /parties/main/:room when connecting to the default party. This is not a breaking change, all projects should still just work as expected.

  PartySocket's been pretty stable, so it's time to cut a v1. We have plans for future features, but it's pretty good right now, so let's ship it.

- [#333](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/333) [`dc324d9`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/dc324d91d9521682bf8490e1fed51d5371a752df) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: `init` doesn't install the right versions of packages

  This fix should pick up the latest versions of partykit /partysocket when installing. We were using the previous beta logic when every package was on the same version. This patch picks up the latest versions of both and uses it.

  (also sneaking in a quick types fix for usePartySocket)

- [#251](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/251) [`049bcac`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/049bcac42aa49e4bddec975c63b7d7984112e450) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - small tweaks to `init`
  - replace `process.env.PARTYKIT_HOST` with just `PARTYKIT_HOST`
  - add a `tsconfig.json`
  - add partykit to devDependencies in `init`
  - strip protocol from host (partysocket, y-partykit)

- [#208](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/208) [`de4e507`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/de4e507cc7bcab1bd1f51b5e83b09a32578c70a3) Thanks [@jevakallio](https://github.com/jevakallio)! - Allow connecting directly to a multiparty using a `party` field on partysocket

- [#215](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/215) [`cc88615`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/cc88615a750744fac151f9a0cfae5a94b0f546e2) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: make PartySocket work inside cloudflare/partykit

  The implementation of `ReconnectingWebSocket` tests whether a WebSocket class is valid by the presence of a static field that's not available on CF's/PK's WebSocket class. It's a bit much anyway, so we just remove the test.

  This uses a weaker implementation to generate conneciton IDs if crypto.randomUUID() isn't available in the browser (re: https://github.com/WICG/uuid/issues/23) Fixes https://github.com/partykit/partykit/issues/53

- [#69](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/69) [`9c3418d`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/9c3418df3cf7173b49217145fb2c77adda4f4330) Thanks [@mellson](https://github.com/mellson)! - Makes partysocket compatible with both esm and cjs.

- [#183](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/183) [`acca510`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/acca510babe8c1b4a463f2d85aa11f0450f0b771) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - partysocket: export ReconnectingWebSocket class from root

- [#35](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/35) [`7eb3b36`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/7eb3b3621027480092a927bec5b6096ba4614027) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - y-partykit (feat): `onCommand` as a server configuration option

  y-partykit currently assumes all messages on the wire are yjs messages (usually all binary data), but we have usecases where we want to send arbitrary commands to the server and act on them (usually still with the context of a doc). So now y-partykit accepts a handler for all string messages that we're calling 'commands' - `onCommand(string, Y.Doc)`.

  Additionally, partysocket now also exports it's base websocket class as partysocket/ws

- [#63](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/63) [`2910f99`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/2910f99154efae0a8cce003b12891b473d39f449) Thanks [@mellson](https://github.com/mellson)! - PartySocket commonjs compatibility and React hook test.
