/*
 * Regenerates the Cap'n Web wordmark and seal:
 *
 *   src/components/logo-paths.ts   the lockup and the seal, as SVG path data
 *   public/favicon.svg             the seal alone, as a standalone file
 *
 * Not part of the build. It runs when the mark itself changes, which is close
 * to never, and it needs a font file and `opentype.js` that the site does not
 * otherwise depend on:
 *
 *   npm i opentype.js
 *   curl -sLO https://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/bonum/qbk2.004otf.zip
 *   unzip -j qbk2.004otf.zip 'texgyrebonum-bold.otf'
 *   node scripts/build-wordmark.mjs texgyrebonum-bold.otf
 *
 * Letterforms are TeX Gyre Bonum Bold, a Bookman clone under the GUST Font
 * License (a free licence modelled on the LPPL). Converting glyphs to outlines
 * is ordinary use of a font; only the resulting paths ship, never the font.
 *
 * URW Bookman Demi is the same design and is what capnproto.org's own mark is
 * set in, but it is AGPL-3 and its font exception covers only "a Postscript or
 * PDF file" -- not SVG on a web page. Bonum is the same shapes without that
 * problem. Do not swap it back.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Everything below is in the coordinate space of capnproto.org's `logo.png`,
 * which is 635px wide, so the measurements taken off that image are the numbers
 * written here. The mark is a parody of it and wants to sit at the same
 * proportions.

 * The reference is not text on a circle, which is what it looks like at a
 * glance. Fitting each glyph of `logo.png` independently -- best scale and
 * rotation by intersection-over-union -- and then least-squares fitting a
 * baseline through the results gives a straight, tilted line per word, with the
 * letters scattered around it.
 *
 * What makes it look hand-lettered rather than typed is that scatter, and it is
 * bigger than it looks: `CAP'N` deviates 21px peak-to-peak from its own
 * baseline, on a cap height of 100. Roughly a fifth of a letter. `PROTO` is
 * calmer at 9px on a cap of 124. Both words also sit at different angles.
 *
 * So each glyph carries three of its own numbers -- an extra rotation, a
 * baseline offset and a size multiplier -- on top of its line's tilt. For
 * `CAP'N` these are the reference's measured residuals. For `WEB` there is
 * nothing to measure, so they are invented to sit in the same range as
 * `PROTO`'s, including its habit of letting the middle letter ride high.
 *
 * `O` and `C` fit poorly (IoU 0.67) because a round letter is nearly invariant
 * under rotation, so their fitted *angles* are noise and were not used. Their
 * positions are fine -- round letters overshoot the baseline, which the fit
 * subtracts before measuring.

 *
 * This cannot lean on CSS -- no custom properties, no `prefers-color-scheme`,
 * no theme attribute -- and it has to look right on GitHub light, GitHub dark,
 * and npm, which now has a dark theme of its own. The usual answer is a
 * `<picture>` with a light and a dark file, but npm's markdown sanitiser is far
 * more aggressive than GitHub's and drops `<source>`, which would leave
 * dark-mode npm users looking at the light variant on a dark page.
 *
 * So the band is translucent all the way down: every layer carries its own
 * alpha and the page shows through all of them. On a white README it is a pale
 * blue wash; on a dark one it settles to a faint blue tint over near-black.
 * That is the point, and it is the same background the site's hero uses in both
 * schemes -- `--cw-band` in `globals.css` -- so the banner, the social cards and
 * the site cannot drift apart.
 *
 * The values below mirror that custom property. SVG gradients and a CSS
 * `background` shorthand cannot share a definition, so this is a hand-kept
 * copy: change one and change the other.
 *
 * Only the seal breaks the edge of the band. It is the one element painted to
 * survive on an unknown background, so it gets the site's treatment: flat
 * orange, no keyline, and a soft drop shadow to lift it off whatever it lands
 * on. Below the band the canvas is fully transparent, so it reads as

  The legend is knocked out of the artwork rather than painted on it, so the
  words are holes and whatever is behind shows through: near-white on a light
  README, near-black on a dark one. Painting them one colour would be wrong on
  one of the two, and a PNG cannot switch.

  The mask wraps *everything*, not just the star, and that is the whole point.
  Masking only the star leaves the seal's shadow under each hole (filling the
  letters with 32% black) and, worse, leaves the band painted behind them: the
  band is translucent, so the glyphs came out at alpha 76 carrying the band's
  own colour instead of at alpha 0. They looked transparent against a dark page
  and wrong against a light one. The letters have to be holes in the composite,
  not holes in one layer of it.

  Because the mask is applied to the whole canvas, its region and its white
  backdrop have to be the whole canvas too. Anything outside a mask's region is
  treated as black, so a seal-sized region here would erase the rest of the art.

/*
 * The fourth and fifth outputs: art for the social cards.
 *
 * The cards themselves are drawn per page by `astro-og-canvas` (34 of them, one
 * per title), and that stays as it is -- it rasterises with canvaskit and wants
 * no browser at build time. What it cannot do is draw this band: it takes a
 * list of gradient stops, and the band is a linear gradient with two elliptical
 * accents over it. So the band is handed to it as a finished `bgImage`, and the
 * mark as a `logo`, both generated here from the same geometry as the README
 * banner. That keeps one source of truth without a browser in the docs build.
 *
 * The band is opaque here, unlike the README's. A social card is composited by
 * Slack or a search engine onto a surface this repository does not control and
 * cannot measure, and a translucent one would come out differently in each. The
 * README can adapt to its page because there are only two of those and both are
 * known.
